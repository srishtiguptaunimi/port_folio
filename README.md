## Welcome to My GitHub Playground! üéâ
Hello there! üëã I'm Srishti Gupta, your friendly neighborhood data scientist. You‚Äôve stumbled upon my GitHub repository, where I like to think of myself as a data wizard, conjuring up insights from the magical realm of numbers and algorithms.

## About Me
I‚Äôm a passionate data enthusiast who believes that data is like pizza ‚Äì even when it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs still pretty good! üçï With a degree in Data Science and Economics from University of Milan, Italy, I‚Äôve dived deep into the world of machine learning and data analysis. My mission? To turn raw data into deliciously insightful stories!

#### Technical Skills: Python, R, SQL, AWS, Azure AI

## What You‚Äôll Find Here
In this repository, you‚Äôll find a collection of my projects that showcase my skills and interests. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek:
- Wine Quality Prediction: Because who doesn‚Äôt want to know if that bottle of Merlot is worth the splurge? This project uses machine learning to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs all about balance!
- and many more projects
